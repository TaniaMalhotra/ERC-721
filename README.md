# Whitelist-NFT-Collection

This repo has contracts for a whitelist dapp that allows early supporters to join the whitelist for nft Collection. 
Being on the whitelist will give them guaranteed access to mint the NFT once the collection launches!

-> Users are allowed to only mint 1 NFT per transaction

-> Whitelisted users are able to mint the NFT for free

-> Other users need to pay 0.01 ETH to mint the NFT
